Narendra Modi

A son of the soil, humble and true,
From tea stall dreams, new visions grew.
Through trials faced and paths untrod,
He walked with faith, his strength in God.

A voice that calls for nation’s rise,
With steady gaze and steadfast eyes.
He speaks of hope, of self-reliance,
Of unity, courage, and firm defiance.

Through bustling streets, his story flows,
In farmer’s fields, the soldier knows.
A leader’s task, both harsh and grand,
To shape the fate of motherland.

History will tell, as time will see,
The mark he leaves on destiny.
For every heart, both young and old,
Remembers the tale of Modi told.
